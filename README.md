# ðŸŽˆ [WIP] BetterMaximize - Click green button to maximize window instead of fullscreen

Click the green maximize button to actually **maximize** the window (like on Windows and other OSes) instead of creating a new 'space/virtual desktop'.

Nothing wrong with the default behaviour but I much prefer this approach. 

## What's wrong with default behavior?

Currently, clicking green button makes the current app take up an entire fullscreen 'space/virtual desktop'. And you need to âŒ¥+click the green button to just maximize the window within the current 'space/virtual desktop'.

This _tiny_ app aims to invert the default behavior. So clicking green button will maximize window and holding âŒ¥ will fullscreen the window.

## Note

This is a WIP, core functionalities not implemented yet.
